# Polyglot-Calculator

A small calculator project made in Java + Rust, the idea here is to test a form of interoperability between the two, where one interacts with the other in a stable way.

This can be considered part of the Klar interoperability study -> [https://github.com/KlarLang/Klar](Klar).

Besides, I really needed a calculator...
